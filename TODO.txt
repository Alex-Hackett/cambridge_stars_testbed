This is the top-level TODO list for the Cambridge Stars testbed

Current Tasks:

	Safety checks in case the meshpoint resolution is ever insufficent
	to cover the area in which the energy is being deposited (a warning
	or an error would be very easy to do, but actually altering the mesh
	to provide the desired resolution seems like it would probably be very
	hard to actually pull off)

	Add triangular and exp spacial energy profiles as options. Will need
	to be defined piecewise, so will probably be a fair bit trickier to
	pull off compared to the sin and the top-hat, but given that the sin
	versus the top-hat doesn't produce a massive change yet, it's probably
	not a top priority

	Add a "time of injection" control, essentially, a method by which
	the desired age of when the energy injection was to start, and when
	it is the end could be selected. Shouldn't be at all difficult to do in
	a very simple on/off style, with the potential problem that the 
	time step could be too large to resolve the injection, and could even
	gloss over the entire desired window completely, will need some way of
	"looking into the future" to see when the window is approaching, and
	to quickly (but not too quickly!!) winding down the time-step to ensure
	that the injection window is properly resolved, and then cranking it
	back up slowly afterwards

	Once time of injection control is added, it would then seem sensible to
	have some control over the injection profile in time, as well as in
	space. This would be more difficult, since, at least mesh-point mass
	spacing doesn't change over the course of a single time-step, where as
	the time-step will (most likely) change over the injection window
	An initial idea might be to freeze the time-step in place during the
	injection window, which would make the maths nice and simple,
	but would probably end up ruining things in various edge cases...
